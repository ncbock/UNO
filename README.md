UNO! is a trademark of the Matel corporation. I claim no rights to the game, this is simply an intellectual exersice.

This program uses the Pygame module, to download Pygame visit https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml. The Pygame module works best with Python3, to download Python3 visit https://www.python.org/downloads/

To play the game clone this repository and enter the directory of the clone from the command line.

Enter the command "python3 uno.py"

You will then be prompted for the number of players that are playing. In the command line enter the number of players, then the name of each player.

Click the start button in the Pygame windo and the game has begun.

At anytimes you can click the rules button to visit a web page of the rules of UNO.

When it is a players turn they must click the Show Cards button to reveal their hand. If they have a card in their hand they may select that card and then click the play card button to play the card. If they do not have a valid play card or they choose not to play, they may click the draw deck that is on the screen. If that card is playable, per the rules of UNO, that card will be added to the play pile. If it is not a valid card it will be added to their hand. 

When a player plays his second to last card, an UNO button will appear on the screen for 5 seconds. The player must click this to call UNO! or they will be exposed to be Called Out. If a player is called out and they have not called UNO 4 cards will be added to their hand. If a player has UNO and has not been called out, upon their next turn they will have the opportunity to call UNO for the duration of their turn or they will be able to play their last card. 

The game ends when a player reaches 500 points, at which point the contestants will have the opportunity to restart the game or quit the game.

You can quit the game at anytime by closing the window or pressing the on screen quit button.
